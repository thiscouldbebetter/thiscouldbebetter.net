				This site is intended to host and distribute the
				computer code, programming blog, and other projects of
				This Could Be Better, an organization dedicated to the
				improvement of humankind, in its own small way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Very small.  Also, maybe not all that dedicated sometimes.
			</p>
			<p>
				But we MEAN well.
