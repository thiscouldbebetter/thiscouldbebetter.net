				After a few years of operating the WordPress.com blog,
				it was decided to start posting the programs published
				on the blog as GitHub repositories as well, so that
				they could be more easily downloaded and modified.
			</p>

			<p>
				That GitHub site is available at
				<a href="https://github.com/thiscouldbebetter">
