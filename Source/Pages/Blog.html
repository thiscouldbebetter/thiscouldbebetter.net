		<h1>Blog</h1>

		<div>
			<p>
				This Could Be Better started out as a WordPress.com blog
				concerned mostly with brain-dead programming tutorials.
				The archives of that blog is still available at WordPress.com,
				though it hasn't seen many updates in recent years, not
				least because the user interface on WordPress.com gets a 
				little harder to use every year.  The current plan is to
				export that blog and host it on this site, where it is
				to be hoped, at the very least, that updating a post
				won't result in half of it disappearing and the rest
				being reformatted willy-nilly as if by whimsical forest
				sprites.
